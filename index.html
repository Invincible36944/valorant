         Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and
          cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the
           attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique
            abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires
             charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or spike actions. Every player starts each round
              with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.Other weapons
               and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money
                based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for,
                 and any actions taken with the spike. The game has an assortment of weapons including 
                 secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns,
                  assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that
                   each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able
